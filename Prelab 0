//For this prelab you are tasked to implement a function that will be passed an array of integers; an integer giving
//the size of the array; and a query integer to be searched for in the array. The function will return a nonnegative
//number representing the number of occurrences of integers in the array that are greater than or equal to the
//query integer. There is no prototype specified for the function, so you're free to choose the name of the
//function and the order in which the parameters are passed.

    int occurences = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < size; i++ ) {
        if(arr[i] >= query) {
            occurences++;
        }
    }
